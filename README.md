# MindMaps
 Here you can see mindmaps for the Softwares that I have tested. 
A mind map is a graphical representation of ideas and concepts. It is a creative and logical way of advanced note-taking using symbols, colors, mind shapes, words, lines, and images.
Those Mindmaps are created using Xmind. It's an open source tool. I have added the MindMaps as png,pdf and Xmind Workbook types.
